# Reanalysis_MinION_Grubaugh2019
This repo develops machine learning models to cluster the true and false positive variants called in the MinION experiments in [Grubaugh2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7). 

One author—[Nicholas J. Loman](https://github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv)—from [Grubaugh2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7) published a Github repo showing the process how they classified the true and false positive MinION variants using a logistic regression model. 

My repo here contains two folders.

Descriptions are to be updated. At this moment, the notebook Reanalysis_MinION_Grubaugh2019.ipynb describes this work and is self-explanatory.
